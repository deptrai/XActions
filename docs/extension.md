## Installation

### Chrome / Edge / Brave (Load Unpacked)

1. Open `chrome://extensions/` (or `edge://extensions/` / `brave://extensions/`)
2. Enable **Developer mode** (toggle in the top-right corner)
3. Click **Load unpacked**
4. Select the `extension/` directory from the Medirus repository
5. The **XA** icon appears in your toolbar
6. **Pin it** — right-click the icon → Pin for easy access

### Firefox (Temporary Add-on)

1. Open `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`
2. Click **Load Temporary Add-on…**
3. Select `extension/manifest.json`
4. The **XA** icon appears in your toolbar

> **Note:** Firefox temporary add-ons are removed when Firefox closes. For persistent installation, the extension must be signed via [addons.mozilla.org](https://addons.mozilla.org).

### Verify Installation

After loading, navigate to **x.com**. Click the **XA** icon:

- **Green dot** in the header = Connected to X ✓
- **Grey dot** = Not on an X/Twitter tab — navigate to x.com first

---

## First Launch

On first install, a **Welcome to Medirus** modal appears:

1. Review the featured automations (Auto-Liker, Smart Unfollow, Video Downloader, Thread Reader)
2. The **"Enable popular features"** checkbox is pre-checked — this auto-configures Video Downloader and Thread Reader with sensible defaults
3. Click **Get Started** to dismiss

You can always reconfigure these in each card's settings later.

## Rate Limits & Safety

### Built-in Protections

- **Hourly/daily action caps**: Max 200 likes/day, 100 follows/day (enforced internally)
- **Randomized delays**: All actions have random delay jitter to appear human
- **Rate limit detection**: Extension monitors HTTP 429 responses from X's API
- **Auto-pause**: When rate limit detected, all automations pause automatically
- **Warning banner**: Yellow banner appears in popup with "Dismiss" button

### Speed Presets

| Preset | Min Delay | Max Delay | Use Case |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Safe** | 3.0s | 6.0s | New accounts, conservative use |
| **Normal** | 2.0s | 5.0s | Standard operation |
| **Fast** | 1.0s | 2.5s | Experienced users only — higher risk |

### Recommendations

- Start with **Safe** speed and low action limits
- Don't run more than 2 growth automations simultaneously
- Monitor the Activity tab for any error messages
- If you get rate-limited, wait at least 15 minutes before resuming

## Troubleshooting

### Extension Not Connecting

**Symptom:** Grey dot, disconnected banner

**Fix:**
1. Make sure you're on `x.com` or `twitter.com`
2. Refresh the page
3. If still disconnected, go to `chrome://extensions/`, find Medirus, click the reload ↻ button

### Automation Not Working

**Symptom:** Started but 0 actions

**Fix:**
1. Check you're on the correct page for that automation (see table above)
2. Check the Activity tab for error messages
3. Ensure keywords match actual tweet content (empty = match all)
4. Open DevTools console (F12) and check for errors

### Rate Limited

**Symptom:** Yellow "Rate limit detected" banner

**Fix:**
1. Click Dismiss
2. Wait 15–30 minutes
3. Reduce speed to Safe
4. Lower max action limits

### Settings Not Saving

**Symptom:** Settings reset when reopening popup

**Fix:**
1. Check that `chrome.storage.local` isn't full (5MB limit)
2. Try Export → Reset All → Import
3. Reload the extension

## FAQ

**Q: Does this use the X/Twitter API?**
No. Medirus operates entirely through browser DOM automation — it clicks real buttons on the real x.com page. No API keys, no fees.

**Q: Can X detect this?**
Medirus mimics human behavior with randomized delays, but no automation is 100% undetectable. Use conservative settings and don't exceed daily limits.

**Q: Does it work when the popup is closed?**
Persistent automations (Video Downloader, Thread Reader) run via MutationObserver in the page and stay active as long as the x.com tab is open. Action-based automations (Auto-Liker, etc.) run in the page context and continue even when the popup is closed.

**Q: Firefox support?**
Works as a temporary add-on. Most features work with Manifest V3 in Firefox 109+. Full Firefox Add-ons Store support is planned.

**Q: Can I run multiple automations at once?**
Yes. The dashboard shows how many are running simultaneously. Be cautious — running too many at once increases rate limit risk.

**Q: Where is my data stored?**
Everything is stored locally in `chrome.storage.local` — never sent to any server. Export to back up your settings.

**Q: How do I uninstall?**
Go to `chrome://extensions/`, find Medirus, click Remove. All stored data is deleted automatically.
