# Skills Reference

**Skills** are self-contained instruction files that teach an AI assistant how to
do one job with XActions. Each is a markdown file with YAML frontmatter, written
for a model to read rather than a human: it names the scripts to run, the page
to run them on, the arguments that matter, and the mistakes to avoid.

They are how you get from "Claude has 144 tools" to "Claude knows which three of
them to use, in what order, for this task."

- Machine-readable index: [`skills/index.json`](../skills/index.json)
- Template for new ones: [`skills/TEMPLATE.md`](../skills/TEMPLATE.md)

## Using them

### With Claude Code

Point Claude at the directory. It reads the frontmatter `description` of each
skill to decide which one applies to your request:

```bash
claude "Read skills/follower-monitoring/SKILL.md and find who unfollowed me this week"
```

### With any assistant

Skills are plain markdown. Paste the contents of a `SKILL.md` into any chat and
the assistant has everything it needs for that job:

```
[paste skills/growth-automation/SKILL.md]

Now set this up for the "AI engineering" niche.
```

### Programmatically

```js
import { readFileSync } from 'node:fs';

const index = JSON.parse(readFileSync('skills/index.json', 'utf8'));
const skill = index.skills.find((s) => s.id === 'follower-monitoring');
const instructions = readFileSync(skill.path, 'utf8');

// Hand `instructions` to your model as a system or user message.
```

## Anatomy of a skill

```markdown
---
name: growth-automation
description: Automates X/Twitter growth via browser console scripts. Auto-likes
  tweets by keyword/user filters, auto-comments on target users... Use when
  automating Twitter growth, engagement, following, or audience building.

# Growth Automation

Browser console scripts for X/Twitter. **Always paste `src/automation/core.js`
first** -- it provides shared config, selectors, utilities, and rate limiting.

## Script Selection

| Goal | File |
|------|------|
| Auto-like timeline tweets | `src/automation/autoLiker.js` |
| Follow users by keyword search | `src/automation/keywordFollow.js` |
```

The `description` is the load-bearing field. It is the only thing an assistant
reads when deciding whether a skill is relevant, so it has to state both what
the skill does *and* when to reach for it. A description that only says what it
does will never get selected.

## Writing one

1. Copy [`skills/TEMPLATE.md`](../skills/TEMPLATE.md) to `skills/your-skill/SKILL.md`.
2. Write the frontmatter. Spend the effort on `description`: name the job and
   the trigger. Compare "Manages bookmarks" with "Organize, export, and
   bulk-clear bookmarks with auto-tagging. Use when someone asks to clean up,
   export, or categorize their saved posts."
3. Write the body for a model, not a person. Concrete file paths, exact page
   URLs, real argument values. Skip the motivation and the history.
4. Lead with a selection table mapping goals to files, so the assistant picks
   correctly before it reads any detail.
5. Add the entry to [`skills/index.json`](../skills/index.json).

Rules that keep a skill useful:

- **Reference real files.** Every path in a skill must exist. A skill that sends
  an agent to a missing script is worse than no skill.
- **State the preconditions.** "Paste `core.js` first", "must be on
  `x.com/USERNAME/followers`", "requires a logged-in session."
- **Say what not to do.** Rate limits, dry-run defaults, and destructive steps
  belong in the skill, because the agent will not infer them.
- **No placeholders.** No `TODO`, no invented arguments.
