# Tutorial 04 — Build a brand monitor

**Time:** 30 minutes · **Login required:** yes · **You need:** Tutorial 01 finished

Build a service that watches X for mentions of a term, scores each one for
sentiment, and posts an alert when something negative appears. By the end you
will have a program you can leave running.

We build it in five passes, each one working before the next starts. That order
matters: it means you always have something you can run, and when a pass breaks
you know exactly which change did it.

```bash
mkdir brand-monitor && cd brand-monitor
npm init -y
npm pkg set type=module
npm install xactions
```

```bash
export X_AUTH_TOKEN=...    # from DevTools > Application > Cookies > x.com
export X_CSRF_TOKEN=...
```

Search is session-tier, so both cookies are required. See
[Tutorial 01, step 4](01-your-first-scrape.md#step-4--log-in).

---

## Pass 1 — Get the mentions

`monitor.js`:

```js
import { Scraper, SearchMode } from 'xactions/client';

const QUERY = process.argv[2] || 'xactions';

const scraper = new Scraper();
await scraper.setCookies(`auth_token=${process.env.X_AUTH_TOKEN}; ct0=${process.env.X_CSRF_TOKEN}`);

for await (const tweet of scraper.searchTweets(QUERY, 20, SearchMode.Latest)) {
  console.log(`@${tweet.username}: ${tweet.text.replace(/\s+/g, ' ').slice(0, 100)}`);
}
```

```bash
node monitor.js "your brand"
```

If this fails with `AUTH_REQUIRED`, your cookies are missing or `ct0` is absent.
Fix that before continuing; nothing below will work without it.

---

## Pass 2 — Only report what is new

A monitor that re-reports the same posts every cycle is noise. Track what you
have seen, and treat the first pass as a baseline rather than alerting on the
entire backlog:

```js
const seen = new Set();
let baseline = true;

async function poll() {
  let fresh = 0;

  for await (const tweet of scraper.searchTweets(QUERY, 25, SearchMode.Latest)) {
    if (seen.has(tweet.id)) continue;
    seen.add(tweet.id);

    // First pass records what already existed. Without this, starting the
    // monitor alerts on months of history at once.
    if (baseline) continue;

    fresh += 1;
    console.log(`@${tweet.username}: ${tweet.text.slice(0, 100)}`);
  }

  if (baseline) {
    baseline = false;
    console.log(`Baseline set: ${seen.size} existing posts ignored.`);
  } else if (fresh === 0) {
    console.log('No new matches.');
  }
}

await poll();
setInterval(poll, 60_000);
```

`seen` grows without bound over a long run. For anything you intend to leave up
for weeks, persist it and cap it: a `Set` of the last 10,000 IDs is plenty,
because X search only reaches back so far anyway.

---

## Pass 3 — Score the sentiment

XActions ships a rule-based analyzer that runs entirely offline: no model, no
key, no network call, no per-request cost.

```js
import { analyzeSentiment } from 'xactions/analytics';

const sentiment = await analyzeSentiment(tweet.text);
// { score: -0.6, label: 'negative', confidence: 1, keywords: ['terrible', 'broken'] }
```

Wire it into the loop:

```js
fresh += 1;
const sentiment = await analyzeSentiment(tweet.text || '');
const marker = { positive: '+', negative: '!', neutral: ' ' }[sentiment.label];

console.log(`${marker} @${tweet.username}: ${tweet.text.slice(0, 90)}`);
console.log(`   https://x.com/${tweet.username}/status/${tweet.id}`);
```

Want a model instead? Same function, same return shape, so nothing downstream
changes:

```js
const sentiment = await analyzeSentiment(tweet.text, { mode: 'llm' });
```

That needs `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`. Start with the rule-based mode. It is free,
instant, and good enough to decide whether something is worth a human look,
which is the only decision this program is making.

---

## Pass 4 — Alert

Printing to a terminal nobody is watching is not monitoring. Post negatives to a
webhook:

```js
async function notify(tweet, sentiment) {
  if (!process.env.ALERT_WEBHOOK) return;

  try {
    await fetch(process.env.ALERT_WEBHOOK, {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        text: `Negative mention by @${tweet.username}: ${tweet.text}`,
        url: `https://x.com/${tweet.username}/status/${tweet.id}`,
        sentiment,
        detectedAt: new Date().toISOString(),
      }),
      signal: AbortSignal.timeout(10_000),
    });
  } catch (error) {
    // A dead webhook must not kill the monitor.
    console.error(`Webhook failed: ${error.message}`);
  }
}
```

```js
if (sentiment.label === 'negative') await notify(tweet, sentiment);
```

Slack and Discord both accept a JSON body with a `text` field, so this works
against either with no changes:

```bash
export ALERT_WEBHOOK=https://hooks.slack.com/services/...
```

## Pass 5 — Survive

The difference between a script and a service is what happens on a bad day.

**A failed poll must not end the run.** Rate limits and transient 5xx both
resolve themselves by the next interval:

```js
async function poll() {
  try {
    // ... the loop
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(`[${new Date().toISOString()}] poll failed: ${error.message}`);
    return;   // Try again next interval.
  }
}
```

**Back off when throttled.** Guest tokens are throttled hard, and even
authenticated search has limits:

```js
catch (error) {
  if (error.code === 'RATE_LIMITED') {
    const waitMs = error.rateLimitReset
      ? Math.max(0, error.rateLimitReset - Date.now())
      : 15 * 60_000;
    console.error(`Rate limited. Sleeping ${Math.round(waitMs / 1000)}s.`);
    await new Promise((r) => setTimeout(r, waitMs));
  }
  return;
}
```

**Shut down cleanly**, so you can tell a stop from a crash:

```js
process.on('SIGINT', () => {
  clearInterval(timer);
  console.log(`\nStopped. ${seen.size} unique posts seen.`);
  process.exit(0);
});
```

**Poll on a sane interval.** 60 seconds is fine for a brand nobody talks about
and wasteful for one that trends. Match it to the volume you actually see, and
remember every poll spends rate-limit budget you might want for something else.

## The finished thing

[`examples/07-keyword-monitor.js`](../examples/07-keyword-monitor.js) is all five
passes assembled, and it runs:

```bash
node examples/07-keyword-monitor.js "your brand" 120
ALERT_WEBHOOK=https://hooks.slack.com/... node examples/07-keyword-monitor.js "your brand"
```

---

## Where to take it

**Watch competitors too.** Run several queries in one process and tag alerts by
which query matched.

**Track it over time.** Write every scored mention to a file or a database and
you have a sentiment trend, which is far more useful than any single alert.
`aggregateResults()` from `xactions/analytics` gives you average, median, and
direction over a batch.

**Reply automatically.** With a session you can `x_reply` from the MCP server or
`scraper.sendTweet()` from the library. Be careful: an auto-responder that
misreads sarcasm is a worse problem than the one it solves.

**Deploy it.** A Dockerfile ships with the repo, and
[docs/deployment.md](../docs/deployment.md) covers Railway, Fly.io, and Docker.
This is a single long-lived process with no database, so the smallest instance
anywhere will do.

## What you learned

- Build in passes, each one runnable, so a break has one obvious cause
- Baseline the first poll or you alert on the entire backlog
- Sentiment analysis runs offline and free; upgrade to a model only if you must
- A failed poll returns, it does not throw
- `error.code === 'RATE_LIMITED'` carries `rateLimitReset`: use it to back off

## Next

- [Examples](../examples/) — more programs to take apart
- [Analytics docs](../docs/analytics.md) — sentiment, reputation, follower tracking
- [Deployment](../docs/deployment.md) — putting it somewhere permanent
