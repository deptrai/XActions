# Contributing to XActions ⚡

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **XActions** — the complete X/Twitter automation platform!

Created by [nich](https://github.com/nirholas) ([@nichxbt](https://x.com/nichxbt))

## 🚀 How to Contribute

### Getting Started

1. **Fork** the repository at [github.com/nirholas/xactions](https://github.com/nirholas/xactions)
2. **Clone** your fork locally
3. **Create a branch** for your feature/fix: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`
4. **Make changes** and commit with clear messages
5. **Push** and open a Pull Request

### Development Setup

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/xactions.git
cd xactions

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment
cp .env.example .env

# Initialize database
npx prisma generate
npx prisma db push

# Start development
npm run dev
```

## ✅ Before you open a PR

Three commands. All of them run in CI, so running them locally saves a round
trip:

```bash
npm test           # 913 tests
npm run docs:check # dead links, stale versions, invented CLI commands
npm run docs:scripts  # only if you added or renamed a browser script
```

`docs:check` is dependency-free and takes about a second. It fails on:

| Problem | Why it is checked |
|---------|-------------------|
| A dead relative link | The first person to notice is a stranger who clicked it and left |
| A dead heading anchor | Same, but harder to spot in review |
| A referenced script that does not exist | Docs telling people to run a deleted file |
| A stale version or MCP tool-count claim | These drifted across 25 files before this existed |
| A documented CLI command that does not exist | The reader assumes they typed it wrong |

If you touched anything that talks to X, also run:

```bash
npm run check:endpoints   # are X's GraphQL query IDs still current?
```

## 📝 Contribution Guidelines

### Code Standards

- ✅ **Small, focused PRs** — easier to review and merge
- ✅ **Clear documentation** — comment your code
- ✅ **No secrets** — never commit credentials or API keys
- ✅ **Test your changes** — ensure nothing breaks
- ✅ **Follow existing patterns** — consistency matters
- ✅ **Never report empty as success** — a scrape that finds nothing must say so
  and say what to do about it. Silently returning `0` or `null` is the single
  most confusing thing this tool can do, and it has happened more than once.

### Types of Contributions Welcome

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 🐛 Bug Fixes | Fix issues or unexpected behavior |

### Pull Request Process

1. Update documentation if adding features
2. Add entries to `docs/` for new functionality

4. Link related issues in PR description
